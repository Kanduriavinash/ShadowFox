Boston House Price Prediction-

This project implements a regression model to predict house prices in Boston using the classic Boston Housing dataset.
It demonstrates key steps in a Machine Learning pipeline such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Features-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature scaling)

Model building using regression algorithms (Linear Regression, etc.)

Model evaluation with metrics (RÂ² score, MSE, RMSE)

Predicting housing prices based on input features.


Tech Stack-

Python 

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

scikit-learn
